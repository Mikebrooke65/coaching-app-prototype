  - Added `division` column to lessons table (`Community` / `Academy`)
  - Added `team_type` column (`First Kicks`, `Fun Football`, `Junior Football`, `Youth Football`, `Senior`)
  - Updated existing 16 U9 lessons to `Community` / `Junior Football`
  - Indexes for filtering

- **First Academy Lesson (Migration 028: Shielding)**
  - Converted Bailey's Slide 1 to full framework format

### Technical Notes
- Games are events with `event_type = 'game'`
- Scores stored directly in events table (team_score, opponent_score)
- Feedback references event IDs via game_id field
- Navigation uses array index for efficient game switching

### Files Created
- `supabase/migrations/024_add_scores_to_events.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/025_fix_game_feedback_for_events.sql`

### Files Modified

### Technical Notes
- Games table stores match-specific data (opponent, scores, home/away)
- Events table is base for all schedule items
- Game events can be linked to games table for extended functionality
- RLS policies enforce that coaches/managers can only manage their team's events
- Event targeting uses array fields for flexible filtering

### Known Limitations

3. Add "New Event" button to Schedule
4. Implement event creation modal with targeting
5. Test full workflow: Create game event → View in Games → Record score → Add feedback

## [2026-03-10] - User Management Automation Complete

### Added
- **Automated User Creation via Netlify Functions**
  - Created Netlify Function `create-user` for single user creation
  - Handles Supabase Auth + users table creation atomically
  - Admin permission verification
  - Random password generation if not provided
  - Team assignment support
  - Automatic rollback on failures

- **Frontend Integration**
  - Updated UserManagement.tsx to call Netlify Function
  - Password field added to user creation form (optional)
  - Better error handling and user feedback
  - CSV bulk import ready (function created but not yet integrated)

### Changed
- **Switched from Supabase Edge Functions to Netlify Functions**
  - Edge Functions had persistent JWT validation issues at infrastructure level
  - Netlify Functions more reliable for this use case
  - Service role key properly secured in Netlify environment variables

### Fixed
- **Environment Variable Configuration**
  - Added SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to Netlify
  - Fixed typo in variable name (ROLY → ROLE)
  - Functions now properly access all required credentials

### Technical Notes
- Netlify Functions use TypeScript with @netlify/functions
- Authentication flow: User JWT → Verify with anon key client → Check admin role → Use service key for creation
- Service role key never exposed to client
- Atomic operations with rollback on failure
- Ready to scale to 200+ users

### Deployment
- Function deployed to: `/.netlify/functions/create-user`
- Environment variables configured in Netlify dashboard
- Successfully tested user creation in production

### Next Steps
1. Integrate bulk CSV import with Netlify Function
2. Test with larger user batches
3. Document user import process for admins

## [2026-03-10] - User Management Edge Functions Deployment and Debugging

### Added
- **Edge Function Deployment Process**
  - Successfully deployed both edge functions to Supabase
  - Used `npx supabase` commands (no global installation needed)
  - Deployment process: login → link project → deploy functions
  - Both functions deployed successfully to production

### Changed
- **Edge Function Authentication Fix**
  - Fixed 401 Unauthorized errors in edge functions
  - Changed from using admin client to verify tokens to using regular client
  - Now creates two Supabase clients:
    - Regular client with user's token for authentication verification
    - Admin client for privileged operations (creating users)
  - Added better error handling and logging in UserManagement component
  - Added session validation before calling edge functions

### Fixed
- **Token Verification Issue**
  - Edge functions were trying to verify user tokens with admin client (incorrect)
  - Now use anon key client with user's authorization header
  - Properly extracts and validates access token from session
  - Added console logging to debug token issues

### In Progress
- **Testing Edge Functions**
  - Functions deployed successfully
  - Authentication fix implemented
  - Waiting for Netlify to redeploy with latest code
  - Need to test user creation after deployment completes

### Technical Notes
- Edge functions require SUPABASE_ANON_KEY for user token verification
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY only used for admin operations
- Token must be passed in Authorization header as `Bearer {token}`
- Session must be active and valid when calling edge functions

### Deployment Commands Used
```bash
npx supabase login
npx supabase link --project-ref pikrxkxpizdezazlwxhb
npx supabase functions deploy create-user
npx supabase functions deploy bulk-create-users
```

### Next Steps
1. Wait for Netlify deployment to complete
2. Test user creation in production
3. Test CSV bulk import
4. Verify users created in both Auth and users table
5. Document any remaining issues

- CSV import now creates users in Supabase Auth automatically
- Service role key operations moved to secure server-side functions

### Fixed
- Eliminated manual UUID copying requirement
- Solved scalability issue for 200+ user imports
- Atomic operations prevent orphaned auth users or table records

### Technical Notes
- Edge functions use Deno runtime
- Service role key only used server-side (never exposed to client)
- Functions verify admin role before allowing user creation
- Failed creations automatically rolled back
- Team assignment supports partial name matching

### Deployment Required
To use this feature, admin must deploy edge functions:

### Fixed
- Repository push configuration - now pushing to correct repository (coaching-app-prototype)
- Build syntax errors in AuthContext.tsx (missing closing braces, removed timeout reference)
- Build syntax errors in Reporting.tsx (className typos, variable name typo)
- Session persistence issue - simplified auth initialization logic
- Removed complex timeout recovery mechanism that was causing "navigating..." hang
- **Desktop navigation not working** - Added `key={location.pathname}` to `<Outlet />` in DesktopLayout to force re-render on route changes
  - Pages were accessible via direct URL but not via navigation links
  - React Router wasn't re-rendering the Outlet component when route changed
  - Solution forces React to treat each route as a new component instance

### Known Issues
- **Session Persistence Not Working** - User gets logged out on page refresh
  - Session IS being saved to localStorage (`sb-pikrxkxpizdezazlwxhb-auth-token` key exists)
  - `supabase.auth.getSession()` was timing out (3 seconds) when trying to read session
  - Implemented simplified auth initialization without timeout recovery
  - Issue may be related to Supabase project configuration or network latency
  - **WORKAROUND**: User must log in again after page refresh
  - **TODO**: Debug why getSession() hangs even though session exists in localStorage
  - **TODO**: Consider alternative session management approach or check Supabase project auth settings

### Technical Notes
- All admin pages follow consistent split-panel or table-based layouts
- CRUD operations working in-memory (not yet connected to Supabase database)
- CSV import uses simple parsing (headers: email, first_name, last_name, role, status, team, cellphone)
- Reporting charts use simple HTML/CSS bar charts (no charting library yet)
- All forms include validation and user feedback
- Modal dialogs for add/edit operations across all management pages
