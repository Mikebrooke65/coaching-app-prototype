# Conversation History

## Session: April 7, 2026 (Part 2) - Lite Users & Tournament Preparation

### Context
After completing Phase 2 Reporting, user clarified that lite user functionality was designed but UI not fully implemented. Also preparing for Tournament feature which depends on lite users.

### Discovery: What Was Designed vs Implemented

#### Database & API (IMPLEMENTED ✅)
- Migration 036: `competitions`, `competition_teams`, `invite_codes`, `caregiver_approvals`, `player_caregivers` tables
- `competitions-api.ts`: CRUD, link/unlink teams, cleanup lite users
- `invites-api.ts`: Generate, validate, redeem invite codes
- `LiteLandingPage.tsx`: Registration form for lite users via invite code
- `user_type` field on users table ('full' or 'lite')

#### UI (MISSING ❌)
- **Invite generation UI**: Managers can't generate invite codes for their teams
- **Manager assignment**: No way to assign a manager when linking team to competition
- **Pending invites view**: No UI to see/manage pending invites
- **Mid-season player addition**: Coaches can't add players mid-season from app
- **Caregiver approval workflow**: Tables exist but no UI

### Key Decision: Rename Competition Types

**Current values**: `'wcr'` and `'other'`
**New values**: `'external_league'` and `'club_tournament'`

**Rationale**: 
- "WCR" is club-specific, not descriptive
- "Other" is vague
- New names clearly describe the purpose:
  - **External League**: Regular season leagues (NZ Football, etc.)
  - **Club Tournament**: Tournaments run BY the club (summer comps, etc.) - these trigger lite user workflows and will have the new Tournament management features

### Tournament Feature Overview

**Two new pages planned:**
1. **Competitions Page** (existing, admin-only): Manage ALL competitions
2. **Tournament Page** (NEW): 
   - Admin: Select Club Tournament to manage (fixtures, standings, match generation)
   - Non-Admin: View their team's tournament (if team is in a Club Tournament)

**Tournament Phase 1 MVP features:**
- Round-robin match generation
- Standings calculation (points, goal difference)
- Matches appear in Schedule as events
- Scores recorded in Games page
- Mobile standings page

### Files Affected by Competition Type Rename

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `supabase/migrations/039_rename_competition_types.sql` | NEW - Alter check constraint |
| `src/types/database.ts` | `'wcr' \| 'other'` → `'external_league' \| 'club_tournament'` |
| `src/pages/desktop/CompetitionsPage.tsx` | Dropdown options, display labels |
| `src/lib/competitions-api.ts` | Cleanup check from `'other'` to `'club_tournament'` |

### Implementation Order

1. **Rename competition types** (migration + code) ← IN PROGRESS
2. **Complete Lite User UI**:
   - Add "Invite Players" button on CompetitionsPage for Club Tournaments
   - Add invite code generation modal
   - Add pending invites panel
   - Add manager assignment when linking teams
3. **Build Tournament Page** (Phase 1 MVP):
   - Admin: Tournament selection, fixture management
   - User: View standings, fixtures for their team
   - Round-robin match generation algorithm
   - Standings calculation

### Reference Documents
- `TOURNAMENT-FEATURE-ANALYSIS.md` - Strategic analysis, ROI, implementation phases
- `TOURNIFY-DETAILED-ANALYSIS.md` - Detailed feature breakdown of competitor
- `.kiro/specs/user-role-management/` - Original lite user spec (requirements, design, tasks)

### Current Status
- ✅ Competition type rename - COMPLETE
- ✅ Lite user UI - COMPLETE
- ✅ Tournament Phase 1 MVP - COMPLETE (code implemented, needs testing)
- ✅ Add Tournament Team quick-create - COMPLETE
- ✅ Missing DB tables fixed (competition_teams, invite_codes)
- ✅ Tournaments nav link added to desktop sidebar

### Next Steps (User Testing)
1. Run migration 040 in Supabase SQL Editor
2. On Competitions page: create a Club Tournament, add 3+ teams (use "Add Tournament Team" for external teams)
3. On Tournaments page: select tournament, configure format (Single Round Robin), set scoring rules
4. Add match day dates, start time, duration, venue, pitches → click "Generate Fixtures"
5. Verify fixtures appear in fixture list grouped by round
6. Verify standings table shows all teams with 0-0-0-0
7. Record scores for fixtures on Games page → verify standings update
8. Check mobile `/tournaments` page shows standings and fixtures
9. Test lite user invite flow: create tournament team → share link → register
10. After testing: proceed to Schedule/Games page integration (tournament badges, filters)

### Tournament Phase 1 MVP Implementation (Completed)

#### Database
- Migration 040: Extended `competitions` table (format, scoring rules, tiebreaker_rules), extended `events` table (competition_id, round_number, match_number, pitch), created `competition_standings` table with RLS

#### Pure Logic Modules (no DB access)
- `round-robin.ts`: Circle method algorithm for single/double round-robin fixture generation, handles odd teams with BYE
- `standings-engine.ts`: Calculates standings from fixtures with configurable scoring rules and tiebreakers (goal_difference, goals_scored, head_to_head, alphabetical)

#### API Layer
- `tournament-api.ts`: getTournamentConfig, updateTournamentConfig, getFixtures, getFixturesByRound, getStandings, getMyTournaments, generateFixtures (with validation, pitch scheduling, bulk insert), recalculateStandings, cancelFixture

#### UI Components
- `StandingsTable.tsx`: Semantic HTML table with team highlighting, loading skeleton, responsive
- `FixtureList.tsx`: Grouped by round, status badges, team highlighting
- `TournamentConfig.tsx`: Admin config panel (format, scoring, fixture generation with match days/pitches)

#### Pages
- `DesktopTournamentPage.tsx`: Admin view with competition selector, config, standings, fixtures
- `TournamentPage.tsx`: Mobile view with tabs (Standings/Fixtures), team highlighting, tournament selector

#### Routes
- `/tournaments` (mobile, all authenticated users)
- `/desktop/tournaments` (desktop, admin only)

#### Integration
- `events-api.ts`: Added `getEventsByCompetition()` method
- Routes configured in `routes/index.tsx`

### Lite User UI Implementation (Completed)

#### CompetitionsPage Enhancements
- **Invite button**: Each team in a Club Tournament has an "Invite" button
- **Invite modal**: Enter email (required) and phone (optional) to generate invite code
- **Generated code display**: Shows code and shareable link with copy button
- **Invites panel**: Shows all invites for selected Club Tournament
  - Status badges: Pending (yellow), Redeemed (green), Expired (red)
  - Copy link button for pending invites
- **Conditional display**: Invite features only show for Club Tournaments

#### invites-api.ts Enhancements
- `getPendingInvitesForCompetition(competitionId)`: Get pending invites for a competition
- `getAllInvitesForCompetition(competitionId)`: Get all invites (pending + redeemed)

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/desktop/CompetitionsPage.tsx` - Full lite user UI
- `src/lib/invites-api.ts` - New competition-specific methods
- `supabase/migrations/039_rename_competition_types.sql` - Type rename migration

## Session: March 23, 2026 - Lesson Builder Enhancements & Allocation System

### Context
Continued from previous session. Focus on Desktop Lesson Builder UI improvements and implementing a lesson allocation system to control which lessons are available to coaches based on age group and division.

### Tasks Completed

#### 1. Fixed Mobile Coaching Division Filtering
- **Issue**: Teams have `division` field but it wasn't being fetched from database
- **Solution**: Updated `fetchUserTeams` query in Coaching.tsx to include `division` field
- **Result**: Mobile coaching page now correctly filters lessons by both age_group AND division

#### 2. Desktop Lesson Builder UI Improvements
- **Smaller lesson cards**: Reduced from 3 lines to 2 lines maximum
  - Changed padding from p-3 to p-2
  - Reduced font sizes (text-sm → text-xs, text-xs → text-[10px])
  - All badges on single line with smaller text
  - Added allocation count badge (e.g., "✓ 3" if allocated to 3 age groups)
- **Save as New button**: Added green "Save as New" button next to "Save Changes"
  - Opens modal prompting for new lesson name
  - Creates copy of lesson with modifications
  - "Save Changes" only appears when editing existing lesson
  - "Create Lesson" appears when creating new

#### 3. Lesson Allocation System (Complete)
- **Created migration 037**: `037_lesson_allocations.sql`
- **Database**:
  - `lesson_allocations` table tracks which lessons are allocated to which age groups
  - Unique constraint on (lesson_id, age_group) prevents duplicates
  - RLS policies: all users can view, only admins can manage
- **Desktop Lesson Builder**:
  - Added "Lesson Allocation" section with U4-U17 age group buttons
  - Click to toggle allocation for each age group
  - Allocated age groups show with green background and checkmark
  - Allocation status updates immediately with optimistic UI
- **Mobile Coaching Page**:
  - Now filters lessons by allocation status
  - Only shows lessons allocated to the team's age group
  - Filters by age_group, division, AND allocation
  - If no lessons allocated, shows "No available lessons" message
- **Bulk Allocation SQL**:
  - Provided SQL to allocate all U9 Community lessons to U9 age group
  - `INSERT INTO lesson_allocations ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`

### Technical Details

**Allocation Logic**:
- Admins allocate lessons to age groups in Lesson Builder
- Community: Typically allocate all 16 lessons to an age group
- Academy: Selectively allocate 2-3 lessons per week
- Mobile coaching filters by: `age_group` (from allocations) + `division` + not delivered
- Removes the lesson's own age_group filter, allowing cross-age allocation

**fetchLessons Changes**:
1. Fetch allocated lesson IDs for team's age group
2. Fetch lessons matching those IDs (regardless of lesson's age_group)
3. Filter by team's division
4. Exclude already delivered lessons
5. If no allocations exist, show no lessons

**UI Updates**:
- Lesson cards show allocation count badge
- Allocation buttons in right panel when lesson selected
- Toggle allocation updates database and refreshes UI
- Error handling with graceful fallback if table doesn't exist

### Files Created
- `supabase/migrations/037_lesson_allocations.sql`

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/Coaching.tsx` - Added division to team query, allocation filtering
- `src/pages/desktop/LessonBuilder.tsx` - Smaller cards, Save as New, allocation UI
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Updated with today's work
- `CONVERSATION-HISTORY.md` - This file

### Current Status
- ✅ Division filtering working on mobile
- ✅ Lesson cards compact and readable
- ✅ Save as New functionality complete
- ✅ Allocation system fully implemented
- ✅ Mobile coaching respects allocations
- ✅ Bulk allocation SQL provided
- ⏳ Ready for testing with real data
- ⏳ Need to run migration on production

### Next Steps
1. Run migration 037 on production Supabase
2. Test allocation workflow: allocate lessons → check mobile coaching
3. Bulk allocate Community lessons for all age groups
4. Selectively allocate Academy lessons
5. Test with multiple teams and divisions

### User Feedback
- User confirmed allocation system matches requirements
- Community vs Academy allocation patterns understood
- Bulk SQL approach appreciated for initial setup

## Session: March 20, 2026 - Desktop UI Enhancements

### Context
Completed major desktop UI improvements across four pages: Games, Resources, Schedule, and Landing. Focus was on replacing mock data with real functionality, improving layouts, and adding proper data integration.

### The Journey

#### Desktop Games Page - Complete Rebuild
Started with a page that had mock data and needed to match mobile functionality. The key challenge was implementing age group filtering for admin users who need to access all teams across the organization.

**Problems Encountered:**
- Initial implementation only showed age groups that had teams
- File got corrupted during string replacement attempts
- Needed to balance admin access (all teams) vs regular user access (assigned teams only)

**Solutions:**
- Deleted and recreated the file in chunks using fsWrite + fsAppend
- Implemented comprehensive age group filter showing U4-U17 (all possible groups)
- Added team count display next to each age group
- Made age group selection required for admin users before team selection
- Two-panel layout: Left (w-1/3) for team selection and games list, Right (w-2/3) for game details and feedback

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Age group dropdown with all U4-U17 options
- Filtered team selection based on selected age group
- Past games list with compact cards showing scores and home/away status
- Game navigation with prev/next arrows
- Score recording and updating
- Team and player feedback management
- Previous feedback display with timestamps
- Integration with real APIs (gamesApi, eventsApi)

#### Desktop Resources Page - Rules Display Fix
The rules were appearing in both the left panel (unformatted list) and right panel (formatted display), causing confusion.

**Solution:**
- Removed the rule sections list from left panel
- Left panel now shows only the age group selector dropdown
- Added helpful text: "Rules will be displayed in the right panel"
- All formatted rules display exclusively in right panel

#### Desktop Schedule Page - Layout Redesign
Changed from modal-based event creation to inline form for better desktop space utilization.

**Changes:**
- Left column narrowed from w-1/2 to w-1/3
- Event cards made more compact (smaller text, tighter spacing)
- Right column expanded to w-2/3 to accommodate inline event form
- Removed "Add Event" button that opened modal
- Form includes all original functionality with enhanced targeting

#### Desktop Landing Page - Real Data Integration
Replaced all "--" placeholders with actual database queries.

**Stats Implemented:**
- Total Users: Count from users table
- Total Teams: Count from teams table  
- Lessons: Count from lessons table
- Sessions: Count from sessions table
- Deliveries This Week: Count from lesson_deliveries (Sunday onwards)
- Feedback This Month: Count from game_feedback (from 1st of month)

**Technical Approach:**
- Single fetchStats function with parallel queries
- Loading state shows "..." during fetch
- Week starts on Sunday (setDay(0))
- Month starts on 1st (setDate(1))

### Tasks Completed

1. ✅ Desktop Games page - replaced mock data with real functionality
2. ✅ Age group filtering (U4-U17) for admin users
3. ✅ Team selection filtered by age group
4. ✅ Game navigation and details display
5. ✅ Score recording functionality
6. ✅ Game feedback management (team and player)
7. ✅ Desktop Resources - fixed rules display
8. ✅ Desktop Schedule - redesigned layout with inline form
9. ✅ Desktop Landing - added real data to all 6 stats
10. ✅ Committed and pushed to both remotes (kiro + origin)
11. ✅ Updated CHANGELOG.md
12. ✅ Updated CONVERSATION-HISTORY.md

### Files Modified

- `src/pages/desktop/DesktopGames.tsx` - Complete rebuild with real data
- `src/pages/desktop/DesktopResources.tsx` - Fixed rules display
- `src/pages/desktop/DesktopSchedule.tsx` - Redesigned layout
- `src/pages/desktop/DesktopLanding.tsx` - Added real stats

### Technical Decisions

**Age Group Filtering:**
- Show all U4-U17 groups regardless of whether teams exist
- Display team count next to each age group for clarity
- Admin users must select age group before seeing teams
- Non-admin users bypass age group filter and see their assigned teams directly

**Data Fetching Strategy:**
- Use Supabase count queries with `{ count: 'exact', head: true }` for efficiency
- Parallel queries for all stats to minimize loading time
- Date calculations done client-side for week/month boundaries

**Layout Philosophy:**
- Desktop pages should utilize available space (no modals when inline forms fit)
- Two-panel layouts: narrower left for navigation/selection, wider right for details/forms
- Compact card designs in list views to show more items

---

## Session: March 13, 2026 - Team Messaging Feature Implementation

### Context
Implemented the full Team Messaging feature from spec to code-complete. The spec was created first (requirements, design, tasks), then all required tasks were executed sequentially.

### The Journey

#### Database Schema (Migrations 033 + 034)
- Created 6 tables: messages, message_recipients, message_read_receipts, message_reactions, message_archives, device_tokens
- RLS policies for all tables scoped to authenticated users
- Auto-read receipt trigger for senders on message creation
- Auto-unarchive trigger (034) removes archive records when a reply is added to an archived thread
- Indexes on team_id+created_at, parent_message_id, sender_id, GIN on recipient_user_ids

#### API Service Layer
- `messaging-api.ts` extending ApiClient with methods for threads, thread detail, compose, reply, read receipts, reactions, archiving, search, and Realtime subscriptions
- Recipient resolution logic for individual, whole_team, management_team, club_admin targeting types
- Read receipt retry with exponential backoff (3 retries)

#### Context and State Management
- `MessagingContext.tsx` provides threads, archived threads, unread count, selected thread state
- Supabase Realtime subscriptions with polling fallback on channel errors (30s interval)
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure

#### UI Components
- MessageCard, ComposeForm, ThreadView, ReplyForm, ReadDetailModal, ReactionPicker, SearchBar, UnreadBadge
- Brand colour Dark Grey #545859 with 20% shading rgba(84, 88, 89, 0.2)

#### Page Integration
- Mobile Messaging.tsx: thread list, search, compose FAB, swipe-to-archive, pull-to-refresh
- Desktop DesktopMessaging.tsx: two-panel layout with thread list and detail view
- "Send Reminder" button added to Schedule.tsx and DesktopSchedule.tsx event cards

### Tasks Completed
1. Database schema and types (migration 033, 034, TypeScript interfaces)
2. API service layer (messaging-api.ts with all methods)
3. Messaging context with Realtime and polling fallback
4. All shared UI components (8 components)
5. Mobile and desktop page integration
6. Event reminder integration on Schedule pages
7. Auto-unarchive on reply and error handling

### Files Created
- `supabase/migrations/033_team_messaging.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/034_auto_unarchive_on_reply.sql`
- `src/lib/messaging-api.ts`
- `src/contexts/MessagingContext.tsx`
- `src/components/messaging/MessageCard.tsx`
- `src/components/messaging/ComposeForm.tsx`
- `src/components/messaging/ThreadView.tsx`
- `src/components/messaging/ReplyForm.tsx`
- `src/components/messaging/ReadDetailModal.tsx`
- `src/components/messaging/ReactionPicker.tsx`
- `src/components/messaging/SearchBar.tsx`
- `src/components/messaging/UnreadBadge.tsx`

### Files Modified
- `src/types/database.ts` (added messaging interfaces)
- `src/pages/Messaging.tsx` (replaced placeholder with real implementation)
- `src/pages/desktop/DesktopMessaging.tsx` (replaced placeholder with two-panel layout)
- `src/pages/Schedule.tsx` (added Send Reminder button)
- `src/pages/desktop/DesktopSchedule.tsx` (added Send Reminder button)

### Technical Decisions
- Used Supabase Realtime for live message updates with polling fallback for reliability
- Optimistic UI updates for send/reply/react/archive actions
- Recipient resolution at send time (not stored as individual rows per user)
- GIN index on recipient_user_ids array for efficient recipient queries
- Auto-unarchive via database trigger to ensure consistency regardless of client

---

## Session: March 12, 2026 - Game Day Subs Bug Fixes & User Role Discovery

### Context
Continuing from previous session where the full Game Day Subs feature was implemented and committed. This session focused on bug fixes found during live testing and uncovered a user role management gap.

### The Journey

#### Bug Fix 1: Schedule X/Y Attendee Count
- Schedule event cards showed "1 attendee" instead of "1/11 attending"
- Added `getTotalMemberCounts()` to `events-api.ts` — counts team_members per event's target_teams
- Updated `Schedule.tsx` to display "X/Y attending" format

#### Bug Fix 2: Subs Attendance Only Showing RSVP'd Users
- Attendance section only showed users who had RSVP'd (just the coach)
- Changed `SubsPage.tsx` to query ALL team members from `team_members` table
- Merged with RSVP status, defaulting to `no_response` for members without RSVPs

#### Bug Fix 3: Coaches in Game Day Squad
- Coach was appearing in the game day squad and starting lineup
- Added `.eq('role', 'player')` filter to team_members query in SubsPage
- Only players now appear in attendance/squad sections

#### Bug Fix 4: Attendance Upsert Failing (ON CONFLICT)
- Clicking "Present" button showed error: "unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification"
- Root cause: Migration 031 created a partial unique index (`WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL`) but PostgREST upsert needs a real unique constraint
- Created migration 032 to add proper `UNIQUE (event_id, user_id)` constraint
- Postgres treats NULLs as distinct in unique constraints, so guest rows (user_id=NULL) don't conflict

#### Discovery: User Role Management Gap
- User appeared in attendance block despite being a coach
- Investigation: `team_members.role = 'player'` but `users.role = 'admin'`
- Two independent role systems:
  - `users.role` = app-level permission (admin/coach/manager/player/caregiver) — shown on Users page
  - `team_members.role` = team-level function (coach/manager/player) — no UI to manage this
- When users are added to teams, `team_members.role` defaults to 'player' regardless of their app role
- Fixed user's record manually via SQL: `UPDATE team_members SET role = 'coach' WHERE user_id = ...`
- **Needs scoping**: Admin UI should allow setting/editing team_members.role when assigning users to teams

### Tasks Completed
1. Fixed Schedule X/Y attendee count
2. Fixed Subs attendance to show all team members
3. Excluded coaches from game day squad
4. Fixed attendance upsert with proper unique constraint (migration 032)
5. Identified and documented user role management gap
6. All fixes committed and pushed to both remotes
7. Added live count-up timer to Substitutions section (MM:SS format, 1st/2nd Half label)
8. Added recorded time display below kick-off and 2nd half buttons
9. Added substitution alert system — flashing orange banner + three-beep audio when rotation window is due
10. Rotation window cards now pulse with stronger highlight when their minute is reached

### Files Created
- `supabase/migrations/032_fix_attendance_unique_constraint.sql`

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/SubsPage.tsx` — Player-only filter, all-members query
- `src/pages/Schedule.tsx` — X/Y attendee count
- `src/lib/events-api.ts` — getTotalMemberCounts method
- `src/components/subs/SubstitutionManager.tsx` — Live timer, alert listener, recorded time display
- `src/components/subs/RandomStrategy.tsx` — Game-minute-tick listener, sub-alert dispatch, due-window pulse

### Technical Decisions
- **Partial index vs real constraint**: PostgREST requires actual unique constraints for upsert onConflict. Partial indexes don't work. Keep both: the partial index for query performance, the constraint for upsert support.
- **Two role systems are correct**: App-level role controls permissions; team-level role controls function within a team. A user can be admin in the app but coach on one team and manager on another.

### Next Steps

#### Subs Feature Testing (Continue)
1. Test live count-up timer (kick-off, 2nd half start, timer resets for 2nd half)
2. Test substitution alerts (flashing banner + beep sound when rotation window minute is reached)
3. Test Coach strategy mode (manual player swaps — select player off, player on, confirm)
4. Test playing time bars (update during active play, correct percentages)
5. Test guest players in lineup and substitutions
6. Test edge cases: zero subs, all players present, partial attendance
7. General UI/UX review of the Subs page flow

#### User Role Management (New Scope — Separate Piece)
1. Scope out the problem: `team_members.role` has no admin UI
2. Options to consider:
   - Add role picker when assigning members to teams in Teams Management
   - Auto-set `team_members.role` based on `users.role` when adding to team
   - Show/edit team roles in Users detail view
   - Allow different roles per team (coach on Team A, manager on Team B)
3. Create spec if needed, or handle as a quick fix in Teams Management page

## Session: March 11, 2026 - Mobile UI Polish and RSVP System

### Context
Continuation of prototype UI refinement. Focus on mobile page polish, compact card designs, RSVP functionality, and establishing visual standards across all pages.

### Tasks Completed

#### 1. Mobile Resources Page UI Improvements
- Added `window.scrollTo(0, 0)` on mount so page loads at top
- Changed nav labels: "Rules, Field Setup, Coach Support, General" → "Rules, Pitch, Guides, General"
- Changed nav layout from `flex overflow-x-auto` to `grid grid-cols-4` for even mobile fit
- Added `categoryMapping` to translate display names back to DB values
- Fixed rule section header background: inline `rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.2)` instead of Tailwind `bg-opacity`
- Changed subtitle to "Guides for Coaches and Managers"

#### 2. Removed Sync Status Indicator
- Removed "idle" sync status from mobile (MainLayout) and desktop (DesktopLayout) headers
- Was a placeholder for unimplemented offline sync — not useful to users

#### 3. Mobile Schedule Page UI Improvements
- Added "Team Events" subtitle under Schedule heading
- Fixed modal scrolling so event creation form is fully accessible
- Added light cyan background to event cards: `rgba(6, 182, 212, 0.2)`
- Fixed missing `</div>` that caused build failure

#### 4. Mobile Games Page Card Styling
- Added 20% orange background: `rgba(234, 120, 0, 0.2)`
- Redesigned game card to be compact: title + badges on one line, date/time/location on single row
- Score displays prominently on card when recorded
- Score recording section reduced to slim single-line row

#### 5. Steering Document Updates
- Added complete colour reference table with hex + rgba for 20% shading
- Added font families (Inter/Aktiv Grotesk Corp for headings, Exo 2 for body)
- Added card/section shading standard: always use 20% opacity via inline `rgba()`
- Strengthened team name display rule: always include age_group prefix
- Fixed Schedule page `getEventTitle` to use `${team.age_group} ${team.name}`

#### 6. RSVP Decline Reasons and Response Tracking
- Migration 026: Added `responded_at` and `decline_reason` to `event_rsvps`
- Decline reason options: Late, Sick, Injured, Holiday, Other
- Modal popup on "Can't Go" to capture reason
- `responded_at` recorded on first response for time-to-respond reporting
- Restyled RSVP buttons: Going = green + tick, Can't Go = red + cross, Maybe = grey + question mark

#### 7. Compact Schedule Event Cards with Attendee Count
- Added `getAttendeeCounts` method to events-api
- Users icon + "X attendees" line on each event card
- Compacted event cards: reduced padding, smaller text, smaller RSVP buttons
- Attendee count updates locally on RSVP for instant feedback

#### 8. Mobile Coaching Page Lesson List Redesign
- 20% green background on "Past Lessons" and "Next Lesson" section headers
- Two-line lesson rows: title on line 1, date/checkbox + skill badge on line 2
- Consistent skill badge sizing, reduced row padding

#### 9. Lesson Detail Page Improvements
- Removed "Session Plan" heading
- Restructured session block headers: grey subtitle + bold black session title
- Green glow border on session blocks
- Reduced lesson title size, removed non-functional star icon

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/Resources.tsx`, `src/pages/Schedule.tsx`, `src/pages/Games.tsx`
- `src/pages/Coaching.tsx`, `src/pages/LessonDetail.tsx`
- `src/layouts/MainLayout.tsx`, `src/layouts/DesktopLayout.tsx`
- `src/lib/events-api.ts`, `src/types/database.ts`
- `.kiro/steering/project-standards.md`
- `supabase/migrations/026_add_rsvp_response_tracking.sql`

### Technical Decisions
- **20% rgba shading standard**: Tailwind `bg-opacity` unreliable with hex colours; inline `rgba()` is the standard
- **Each page has its own brand colour** for card/section shading (see steering doc table)
- **Team names always include age_group prefix** as the unique identifier

### User Corrections
- Team names must ALWAYS be "Age Group + Team Name" (e.g., "U9 Lithium")
- Always push to BOTH remotes: `git push kiro prototype; git push origin prototype`
- Migration 026 was run manually in Supabase

---

## Session: March 10, 2026 (Part 3) - Games Page Integration with Events System

### Context
Continued from Part 2. Games page was built but pulling from wrong table. User created a game event in Schedule, but it wasn't showing in Games page because Games was querying `games` table while events are in `events` table.

### The Journey

#### Problem Discovery
- User created game event in Schedule successfully
- Navigated to Games page - showed "No past games found"
- **Root Cause**: Games page querying `games` table, but games are stored in `events` table with `event_type = 'game'`
- Architecture: A game is just an event with extra fields (opponent, home_away)

#### Solution 1: Connect Games to Events
- Updated `loadGames()` in Games.tsx to query `events` table
- Filter by `event_type = 'game'`
- Filter by `target_teams` contains selected team ID
- Filter by past dates only (`event_date < now`)
- Convert event format to Game format for display
- Fixed team display to show "U9 Lithium" format (age_group + name)

#### UI Improvement: Navigation Arrows
- User feedback: Dropdown game selector was clunky
- **New Design**: Single game card with left/right navigation arrows
- Left arrow = go back in time (older games)
- Right arrow = go forward in time (newer games)
- Shows "Game X of Y" counter
- Arrows disabled at first/last game
- Much cleaner UX

#### Problem: Score Saving Failed
- Error: "Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object"
- **Root Cause**: `updateGameScore` in games-api trying to update `games` table
- But we're using event IDs from `events` table
- **Solution**: Add score fields to events table

#### Migration 024: Add Scores to Events
- Added `team_score` and `opponent_score` INTEGER fields to events table
- Created `updateEventScore` method in events-api.ts
- Updated Event type to include score fields
- Games page now saves scores to events table successfully

#### Problem: Score Validation Too Strict
- Error: "Please enter valid scores"
- **Root Cause**: Empty string inputs parsed as NaN
- Input fields start with `''` not `'0'`
- **Solution**: Handle empty strings as 0 in validation
- `teamScore === '' ? 0 : parseInt(teamScore)`

#### Problem: Coaches in Player Dropdown
- User noticed coach appearing in player selection
- **Root Cause**: `getTeamPlayers` only filtering by team_members.role
- Coach might have role='player' in team_members but role='coach' in users table
- **Solution**: Double filter
  - Filter team_members by role='player'
  - Filter users by role='player'
  - Use `!inner` join to ensure user exists

#### Enhancement: Feedback Form Workflow
- User wanted form to clear after saving
- User wanted to edit existing feedback by reselecting team/player
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `currentFeedbackId` state to track if editing
  - `handleFeedbackTypeChange` loads existing team feedback if any
  - `handlePlayerChange` loads existing player feedback if any
  - After save: clear form, reset to "Team" selection
  - Button shows "Update Feedback" when editing, "Save Feedback" when creating

#### Problem: Feedback Not Saving
- Feedback save appeared to do nothing
- **Root Cause**: `game_feedback.game_id` has foreign key to `games` table
- But we're passing event IDs (from `events` table)
- Foreign key constraint failing silently

#### Migration 025: Fix Feedback Foreign Key
- Dropped constraint `game_feedback_game_id_fkey` to games table
- Added new constraint to reference `events(id)` instead
- Feedback now saves successfully with event IDs

### Tasks Completed

#### 1. Connected Games Page to Events System
- Updated loadGames to query events table
- Filter by event_type='game', target_teams, past dates
- Convert events to Game format for display
- Team display shows "Age Group + Name" format

#### 2. Improved Game Navigation UI
- Replaced dropdown selector with navigation arrows
- Left/right arrows to navigate between games
- Game counter shows current position
- Cleaner, more intuitive interface

#### 3. Added Score Recording
- Migration 024: Added score fields to events table
- Created updateEventScore in events-api
- Score validation handles empty inputs (defaults to 0)
- Scores persist and display correctly

#### 4. Enhanced Feedback System
- Form clears after saving
- Resets to "Team" selection
- Loads existing feedback when reselecting team/player
- Shows "Update" vs "Save" button appropriately
- Allows editing/appending to existing feedback

#### 5. Fixed Player Filtering
- Updated getTeamPlayers to double-filter
- Filters team_members.role='player'
- Filters users.role='player'
- Coaches no longer appear in player dropdown

#### 6. Fixed Feedback Database Constraint
- Migration 025: Updated foreign key to reference events
- Feedback now saves successfully

### Files Created
- `supabase/migrations/024_add_scores_to_events.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/025_fix_game_feedback_for_events.sql`

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/Games.tsx` - Complete rebuild with events integration
- `src/lib/events-api.ts` - Added updateEventScore method
- `src/lib/games-api.ts` - Fixed getTeamPlayers filtering
- `src/types/database.ts` - Added score fields to Event type
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Updated with today's work
- `CONVERSATION-HISTORY.md` - This file

### Technical Decisions

**Architecture Clarification**:
- Games ARE events (event_type='game')
- Not separate entities
- Events table is source of truth
- game_feedback references events, not games table

**Score Storage**:
- Scores stored directly in events table
- Added team_score and opponent_score fields
- Simpler than separate games table
- Keeps all game data in one place

**Feedback Workflow**:
- One feedback record per team/player per game
- Editing updates existing record
- No duplicate feedback for same target
- Form resets after save for quick entry

**Navigation Pattern**:
- Array-based navigation (index)
- More efficient than re-querying
- Arrows provide clear direction
- Counter shows position

### Current Status
- ✅ Games page connected to events system
- ✅ Score recording working
- ✅ Feedback system working with edit capability
- ✅ Player filtering correct
- ✅ Navigation arrows implemented
- ✅ Team display format correct
- ✅ All database constraints fixed
- ⏳ Ready for testing with multiple games
- ⏳ Schedule page has basic event creation (needs polish)

### Next Steps
1. Test full workflow with multiple games and players
2. Add ability to delete feedback
3. Polish Schedule page event creation UI
4. Consider adding game notes/summary field
5. Test with real data (multiple teams, games, players)

### User Feedback
- User happy with navigation arrow approach
- Cleaner than dropdown selector
- Feedback workflow makes sense
- Ready to test with real data

### Time Breakdown
- Connecting to events: ~20 minutes
- Navigation arrows UI: ~15 minutes
- Score recording: ~20 minutes
- Feedback enhancements: ~25 minutes
- Bug fixes: ~20 minutes
- Deployment issue resolution: ~15 minutes
- **Total**: ~2 hours

### Deployment Configuration
- **Issue**: Netlify not deploying after git push
- **Root Cause**: Two repositories exist:
  - `github.com/Mikebrooke65/.kiro` (Netlify watches this)
  - `github.com/Mikebrooke65/coaching-app-prototype` (backup)
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `kiro` remote to local git config
  - Set as default push remote
  - Created DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md
  - Created .kiro/steering/project-standards.md for automatic context
- **Standard Practice**: Push to both: `git push kiro prototype && git push origin prototype`

## Session: March 10, 2026 (Part 2) - Games and Schedule System Foundation

### Context
User wanted to build the Games feature for recording match feedback and scores. This evolved into understanding the relationship between Schedule (events) and Games (match-specific data with feedback).

### The Journey

#### Initial Approach: Standalone Games System
- Created `games` table with match details (opponent, venue, home/away, scores)
- Created `game_feedback` table for team and player feedback
- Built Games API service with CRUD operations
- Built Games page UI with score recording and feedback sections

#### Discovery: Table Confusion
- **Problem**: Games page showed "No teams assigned" even though user was assigned to U9 Lithium
- **Root Cause**: App has BOTH `user_teams` and `team_members` tables
- **Investigation**: 
  - Teams Management uses `team_members`
  - AuthContext uses `user_teams` for profile loading
  - Games page initially used `user_teams` (wrong!)
- **Fix**: Updated Games page to use `team_members` consistently
- **Result**: Team now displays correctly

#### Architecture Clarification
- User explained: "A game is just an event, but with extra details"
- Schedule shows all events (training, matches, meetings, social)
- Games filters to match events and adds feedback capability
- Match/Game are the same thing (use "Game" in UI)

#### Events System Design
- Created `events` table for schedule management
- Event types: game, training, general
- Game events have opponent and home/away fields
- Flexible targeting (teams, roles, divisions, age groups)
- Coaches/Managers can only create events for their teams
- Admins have full targeting (except games = single team only)
- Event display: "Your Team vs Opposition" (home) or "Opposition vs Your Team" (away)

### Tasks Completed

#### 1. Games Database (Migration 022)
- **Tables**:
  - `games` - Match details, opponent, venue, home/away, scores
  - `game_feedback` - Team and player-specific feedback
- **RLS Policies**:
  - Admins see/manage all
  - Coaches/Managers see/manage their team's games
  - Users can only update/delete their own feedback
- **Status**: ✅ Complete and deployed

#### 2. Events Database (Migration 023)
- **Tables**:
  - `events` - Schedule items (game, training, general)
  - `event_rsvps` - Attendance tracking
- **Features**:
  - Game events include opponent and home/away
  - Flexible targeting arrays (teams, roles, divisions, age groups)
  - Empty targeting = visible to all
- **RLS Policies**:
  - Users see events targeted to them
  - Coaches/Managers can only create events for their teams
  - Admins have full access
- **Type Casting Fix**: Added `::text` casts for enum comparisons
- **Status**: ✅ Complete and deployed

#### 3. Games API Service
- **File**: `src/lib/games-api.ts`
- **Functions**:
  - Get games by team
  - Update game scores
  - Get team players (for feedback)
  - Create/read/update/delete feedback
  - Get most recent past game
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

#### 4. Games Page UI
- **File**: `src/pages/Games.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Team selection (loads from team_members)
  - Game list display
  - Score recording inputs
  - Team/Player feedback toggle
  - Player roster dropdown
  - Feedback textarea
  - Previous feedback display
- **Current State**: Shows team correctly, waiting for game data
- **Limitation**: UI sections only show when game is selected
- **Status**: ⚠️ Partially complete - needs event data

#### 5. Database Types
- **File**: `src/types/database.ts`
- **Added**:
  - `TeamMember` - Team roster assignments
  - `Game` - Match details
  - `GameFeedbackRecord` - Feedback records
  - `Event` - Schedule items
  - `EventRsvp` - Attendance tracking
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

### Issues Encountered and Resolved

1. **Table Confusion (user_teams vs team_members)**
   - Multiple attempts to fix team loading
   - Finally discovered Teams Management uses team_members
   - Updated Games page to match
   - Added debug logging to troubleshoot

2. **Type Casting in RLS Policies**
   - Error: "operator does not exist: user_role = text"
   - Root cause: role column is enum type
   - Fix: Added `::text` casts to all role comparisons
   - Applied to all policies in migration 023

3. **Context Loss**
   - User noted I was "starting with no information"
   - Reminded to read conversation history and changelog
   - Important for maintaining continuity across sessions

### Technical Decisions

**Architecture**:
- `events` table = base for all schedule items
- `games` table = extended data for match events
- Schedule page shows all events
- Games page filters to matches and adds feedback

**Table Usage**:
- `team_members` = primary table for team assignments (used by Teams Management)
- `user_teams` = used by AuthContext for profile loading
- Both exist but serve different purposes

**Event Display Logic**:
- Home game: "Your Team vs Opposition"
- Away game: "Opposition vs Your Team"
- Training/General: Standard display

### Files Created
- `supabase/migrations/022_create_games_and_feedback.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/023_create_events.sql`
- `src/lib/games-api.ts`
- `GAMES-FEATURE-SUMMARY.md`

- `src/types/database.ts` - Added Game and Event types
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Updated with today's work
- `CONVERSATION-HISTORY.md` - This file

### Current Status
- ✅ Games database complete
- ✅ Events database complete
- ✅ Games API complete
- ✅ Games page shows team correctly
- ⏳ Schedule page needs event creation UI
- ⏳ Need to connect Games to events data
- ⏳ Need to test full workflow

### Next Steps
1. Build Schedule page with event creation UI
2. Add "New Event" button at top
3. Create event modal with:
   - Event type selector (Game/Training/General)
   - Conditional fields (opponent + home/away for games)
   - Targeting options (teams, roles, divisions, age groups)
   - Coach/Manager restrictions (only their teams)
4. Connect Games page to pull from events (type='game')
5. Test workflow: Create game → View in Games → Record score → Add feedback

### Time Breakdown
- Games feature: ~2 hours
- Table confusion debugging: ~30 minutes
- Events system: ~1 hour
- Documentation: ~30 minutes
- **Total**: ~4 hours

### User Feedback
- User patient through table confusion debugging
- Appreciated documentation updates for context preservation
- Confirmed architecture: games are events with extra details
- Ready to continue with Schedule UI next session

## Session: March 10, 2026 - User Management Automation (FINALLY Working!)

### Context
User needed to automate user creation to scale to 200+ users. Previous manual process:
1. Create user in Supabase Auth Dashboard
2. Copy UUID
3. Insert into users table

This session took 3+ hours due to multiple technical challenges (and one typo 😅).

### The Journey

#### Attempt 1: Supabase Edge Functions (Failed)
- Created `create-user` and `bulk-create-users` edge functions
- Deployed successfully to Supabase
- **Problem**: Persistent 401 "Invalid JWT" errors
- **Root Cause**: Supabase's edge runtime was validating JWTs at infrastructure level and blocking requests before they reached our code
- **Attempts to fix**:
  - Tried different JWT verification methods
  - Tried using admin client vs anon client
  - Tried decoding JWT manually
  - Added `verify_jwt = false` config (didn't work)
  - Tried multiple import methods (esm.sh, npm:, different versions)
  - All attempts failed - infrastructure kept blocking with 401

#### Attempt 2: Netlify Functions (SUCCESS!)
- Pivoted to Netlify Functions instead of Supabase Edge Functions
- Created `netlify/functions/create-user.ts`
- **Initial Problem**: Environment variables not found
- **Debugging**: Added detailed logging to see which vars were missing
- **Discovery**: `serviceKey: true` (missing!)
- **User's Typo**: Variable was named `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLY_KEY` instead of `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` 😂
- **Fix**: Corrected typo, forced redeploy
- **Result**: ✅ USER CREATED SUCCESSFULLY!

### Tasks Completed

#### 1. Created Netlify Function
- **File**: `netlify/functions/create-user.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Verifies user authentication with JWT
  - Checks admin role in database
  - Creates user in Supabase Auth
  - Creates matching record in users table
  - Assigns to team if specified
  - Generates random password if not provided
  - Atomic operation with rollback on failure
  - Detailed error messages for debugging

#### 2. Updated Frontend
- Modified `src/pages/desktop/UserManagement.tsx`:
  - Calls Netlify Function at `/.netlify/functions/create-user`
  - Sends user's JWT in Authorization header
  - Better error handling and logging
  - Password field added (optional)

#### 3. Configured Environment Variables
- Added to Netlify:
  - `SUPABASE_URL`
  - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (after fixing typo!)
- Functions access both VITE_ prefixed and non-prefixed versions

#### 4. Documentation
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with complete journey
- Updated CONVERSATION-HISTORY.md (this file)
- Documented the typo for posterity 😄

### Files Created
- `netlify/functions/create-user.ts` - Working Netlify Function
- `supabase/functions/create-user/index.ts` - Abandoned Edge Function
- `supabase/functions/bulk-create-users/index.ts` - Abandoned Edge Function
- `supabase/functions/create-user/config.toml` - Didn't help

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/desktop/UserManagement.tsx` - Updated to call Netlify Function
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added complete story
- `CONVERSATION-HISTORY.md` - This file

### Technical Details

**Why Netlify Functions Worked**:
- No JWT validation at infrastructure level
- Direct access to environment variables
- Standard Node.js/TypeScript environment
- More predictable behavior than Deno edge runtime

**Authentication Flow**:
1. Frontend gets user's session: `supabase.auth.getSession()`
2. Extracts `access_token`
3. Sends to Netlify Function in `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
4. Function creates anon key client with user's token
5. Calls `supabaseClient.auth.getUser()` to verify authentication
6. Checks user's role in users table
7. If admin, uses service role key to create new user

**Security**:
- Service role key stored securely in Netlify environment variables
- Never exposed to client
- Admin role verified before any operations
- Failed operations automatically rolled back

### Time Breakdown
- **Total**: ~3 hours
- **Edge Functions attempts**: ~2.5 hours
- **Netlify Functions implementation**: ~15 minutes
- **Environment variable typo debugging**: ~15 minutes (user's typo!)

### Lessons Learned
1. Supabase Edge Functions have JWT validation at infrastructure level that can't be easily disabled
2. Netlify Functions are more straightforward for this use case
3. Always double-check environment variable names (ROLE not ROLY!)
4. Detailed error logging is essential for debugging
5. Sometimes the simplest solution (Netlify Functions) is better than the "correct" solution (Edge Functions)

### Current Status
- ✅ User creation working in production
- ✅ Admin verification working
- ✅ Atomic operations with rollback
- ✅ Ready to scale to 200+ users
- ⏳ Bulk CSV import function created but not yet integrated

### Next Steps
1. Test creating multiple users
2. Integrate bulk CSV import with Netlify Function
3. Document user import process for admins
4. Celebrate! 🎉

### User Feedback
User was patient through 3 hours of troubleshooting and maintained good humor about the typo. Successfully deployed and tested in production!

## Session: March 10, 2026 - User Management Edge Functions Deployment

### Context
User needed to automate the user creation process which previously required:
1. Manually creating user in Supabase Auth Dashboard
2. Copying the generated UUID
3. Manually inserting into users table

This doesn't scale to 200+ users needed for production.

### Tasks Completed

#### 1. Created Supabase Edge Functions
- **Created `create-user` function** (`supabase/functions/create-user/index.ts`):
  - Handles single user creation
  - Verifies admin permissions
  - Creates user in Supabase Auth
  - Creates matching record in users table
  - Assigns to team if specified
  - Generates random password if not provided
  - Atomic operation with rollback on failure

- **Created `bulk-create-users` function** (`supabase/functions/bulk-create-users/index.ts`):
  - Handles CSV batch imports
  - Processes multiple users in sequence
  - Returns detailed success/failure report
  - Same security and validation as single user creation

#### 2. Updated UserManagement Component
- Modified `src/pages/desktop/UserManagement.tsx`:
  - Calls edge functions instead of trying to use admin API directly
  - Added password field to user creation form (optional)
  - Email field disabled when editing (cannot change after creation)
  - Better error handling and user feedback
  - CSV import now uses bulk-create-users function

#### 3. Created Documentation
- **DEPLOY-EDGE-FUNCTIONS.md**: Step-by-step deployment guide
- **USER-MANAGEMENT-SOLUTION.md**: Complete solution overview
- **supabase/functions/README.md**: Technical documentation

#### 4. Deployed Edge Functions
- **Installation Method**: Used `npx supabase` (no global install needed)
- **Deployment Steps**:
  1. `npx supabase login` - Authenticated via browser
  2. `npx supabase link --project-ref pikrxkxpizdezazlwxhb` - Linked project
  3. `npx supabase functions deploy create-user` - Deployed first function
  4. `npx supabase functions deploy bulk-create-users` - Deployed second function
- **Result**: Both functions successfully deployed to production

#### 5. Debugged Authentication Issues
- **Problem**: Functions returning 401 Unauthorized
- **Root Cause**: Functions were using admin client to verify user tokens (incorrect)
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed to use regular Supabase client with anon key for token verification
  - Create two clients: one for auth verification, one for admin operations
  - Properly extract access token from session
  - Added validation and error logging

- **Code Changes**:
  - Fixed both edge functions to use correct authentication flow
  - Redeployed both functions with fixes
  - Updated UserManagement component with better session handling
  - Added console logging for debugging

#### 6. Pushed Code and Waiting for Deployment
- Committed all changes to git
- Pushed to GitHub prototype branch
- Netlify will auto-deploy (waiting for build to complete)
- Need to test after deployment finishes

### Files Created
- `supabase/functions/create-user/index.ts`
- `supabase/functions/bulk-create-users/index.ts`
- `supabase/functions/README.md`
- `DEPLOY-EDGE-FUNCTIONS.md`
- `USER-MANAGEMENT-SOLUTION.md`

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/desktop/UserManagement.tsx` - Updated to call edge functions
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added deployment and debugging entries
- `CONVERSATION-HISTORY.md` - This file

### Technical Details

**Edge Function Architecture**:
- Written in TypeScript for Deno runtime
- Use Supabase JS client v2
- CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Two-client pattern:
  - Regular client (anon key) for user authentication
  - Admin client (service role key) for privileged operations

**Authentication Flow**:
1. Frontend gets user's session with `supabase.auth.getSession()`
2. Extracts `access_token` from session
3. Sends to edge function in `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
4. Edge function creates regular client with user's token
5. Calls `supabaseClient.auth.getUser()` to verify authentication
6. Checks user's role in users table
7. If admin, proceeds with user creation using admin client

**Security**:
- Service role key never exposed to client
- Admin role verified before any operations
- Failed auth user creations automatically rolled back
- Detailed error messages for debugging

### Issues Encountered

1. **npm install -g supabase failed**
   - Error: "Installing Supabase CLI as a global module is not supported"
   - Solution: Used `npx supabase` instead (no installation needed)

2. **401 Unauthorized errors**
   - Functions were using admin client to verify user tokens
   - Admin client can't verify regular user session tokens
   - Fixed by using regular client with anon key for verification

3. **Missing authorization header**
   - Initial logs showed no auth header being sent
   - Added better session validation in frontend
   - Added logging to debug token extraction

### Current Status
- ✅ Edge functions created and deployed
- ✅ Authentication fix implemented and redeployed
- ✅ Frontend code updated with better error handling
- ✅ Code committed and pushed to GitHub
- ⏳ Waiting for Netlify to redeploy with latest code
- ⏳ Need to test user creation after deployment

### Next Steps

## Session: March 11, 2026 (Part 2) - Bailey Academy Lesson Image Mapping & Schema Migration

### Context
Continuation from Part 1 (same day). Previous session completed the Bailey lesson analysis, deduplication, field mapping, gap analysis, and header-to-scrape mapping. This session focused on: committing outstanding analysis docs, creating the schema migration for Academy/Community division support, generating the first Academy lesson SQL, and building the image-to-session mapping from the original Google Slides `.pptx` export.

### Tasks Completed

#### 1. Committed Outstanding Analysis Documents
- Committed `BAILEY-HEADER-TO-SCRAPE-MAPPING.md` (new), `BAILEY-LESSON-ANALYSIS.md` (updated with Step 9), and `bailey-slide-headers.md` (new)
- Pushed to both `kiro` and `origin` remotes
- Commit: `a68fb79`

#### 2. Schema Migration: Division and Team Type (Migration 027)
- Created `supabase/migrations/027_add_division_and_team_type.sql`
- Added `division` column to lessons table: `Community` or `Academy` (CHECK constraint, default `Community`)
- Added `team_type` column to lessons table: `First Kicks`, `Fun Football`, `Junior Football`, `Youth Football`, `Senior`
- Updated all existing U9 lessons to `division='Community'`, `team_type='Junior Football'`
- Added indexes for filtering

#### 3. First Academy Lesson SQL (Migration 028)
- Created `supabase/migrations/028_academy-shielding-lesson-01.sql`
- Converted Bailey's Slide 1 (Shielding, 10.1.25) to full framework format
- 4 sessions: Ball Mastery & Juggling (15min), Shark Attack (10min), 1v1 Shielding (15min), Game (20min)
- Bailey's coaching points, objectives, focus, and durations preserved exactly
- Generated missing fields: organisation, equipment, steps, pitch layout descriptions
- Lesson tagged as `division='Academy'`, `team_type='Junior Football'`, `skill_category='Shielding'`
- Total duration: 60 minutes (Bailey's original, not standardised to 65)

#### 4. Image-to-Session Mapping from .pptx Export
- User unzipped the original Google Slides `.pptx` file and copied `slides/`, `media/`, etc. into project root
- Created `scripts/parse-slide-images.cjs` — parses all 61 `slides/_rels/*.xml.rels` files to extract image references per slide
- Created `scripts/map-images-to-sessions.cjs` — parses slide XML to determine image x-position, maps each image to session column (1-4) based on the 4-column slide layout
- Identified `image7.png` as template logo (on all 61 slides — excluded)
- Discovered Bailey heavily reuses images: `image5.png` (standard warmup) on 28 slides, `image43.png` (standard game layout) on 22 slides
- Generated complete mapping: `BAILEY-IMAGE-MAPPING.md` (readable table) and `bailey-image-mapping.json` (machine-readable)
- 82 unique content images across 47 slides (excluding template logo)

#### 5. Gitignore Updates
- Added `media/`, `slides/`, `slideLayouts/`, `slideMasters/`, `notesMasters/`, `theme/`, `_rels/`, `bailey-image-mapping.json` to `.gitignore`
- Images stay local only (will be uploaded to Supabase Storage), XML/rels tracked for mapping reference

### Files Created
- `supabase/migrations/027_add_division_and_team_type.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/028_academy-shielding-lesson-01.sql`
- `scripts/parse-slide-images.cjs`
- `scripts/map-images-to-sessions.cjs`
- `BAILEY-IMAGE-MAPPING.md`
- `bailey-image-mapping.json` (gitignored)

### Files Modified
- `.gitignore` — added pptx export folders and image mapping json
- `BAILEY-LESSON-ANALYSIS.md` — committed with Step 9 (slide headers)
- `BAILEY-HEADER-TO-SCRAPE-MAPPING.md` — committed (was untracked)
- `bailey-slide-headers.md` — committed (was untracked)

### Technical Decisions
- **Bailey's durations preserved** — not standardised to 20/15/15/15. His 15/10/15/20 pattern for Shielding kept as-is.
- **Session naming convention**: `session-academy-{topic}-{session-name}-junior` for Academy lessons
- **Skill category**: Using Bailey's topic name (e.g. `Shielding`) even though it's not in the current 8-skill CHECK constraint — the constraint is TEXT NOT NULL with no CHECK in the actual schema
- **Image reuse**: Many images shared across slides. Upload once to Supabase Storage, reference from multiple sessions.

### Git Commits
- `a68fb79` — Bailey analysis docs (header-to-scrape mapping, slide headers, updated analysis)
- `03e49b3` — Image mapping, schema migration, first Academy lesson

---

## NEXT STEPS (for next session)

### Immediate
1. **User to decide**: Proceed with the 34 scraped slides we have, or re-scrape the 13 missing ones first?
   - Missing slides: 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 20, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47
2. **User to review** the first Academy lesson (Migration 028 — Shielding) and confirm the format/quality is right before batch-generating the rest
3. **Run Migration 027** in Supabase to add `division` and `team_type` columns

### Once Approved
4. **Batch-generate remaining Academy lessons** — convert each scraped slide to full framework SQL using Bailey's content as the prompt
5. **Upload images to Supabase Storage** — use the image mapping to rename and upload the 82 content images
6. **Update session `diagram_url`** fields to point to uploaded images
7. **Run all lesson migrations** in Supabase

### Parked for Later
- General lessons (Slides 1–10, no specific age group) — 10 lessons
- U11/U12 specific lessons (Slides 14, 19, 40) — 3 lessons
- Summer Academy lessons (Slides 45–47) — 3 lessons
- Expanding skill categories (wait for Bailey to review and confirm)
- U10 Community lessons (16 lessons, same 8 skills as U9)
- Resolving header-to-scrape name mismatches (slides 18–33 have offset numbering)
